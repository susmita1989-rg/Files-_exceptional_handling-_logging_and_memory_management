It is used almost in every technical domain. In contrast to a programming language, memory management is related to writing memory-efficient code. We cannot overlook the importance of memory management while implementing a large amount of data. Improper memory management leads to slowness on the application and the server-side components. It also becomes the reason of improper working. If the memory is not handled well, it will take much time while preprocessing the data."
